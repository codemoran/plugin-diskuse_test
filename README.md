plugin-diskuse_summary
======================

This plugin scans one or more devices/drives for available disk space as a percentage.
The most used disk will be reported as the measurement.
Although per-disk / per-server graphs may be more complete this plugin aims to help target potential problems as concisely as possible.

**Windows Users**, you need to install [Drivespace](https://github.com/keverw/drivespace) so the plugin can collect statistics.  Make sure it is in your path.  (ex. C:\Windows\System32\drivespace.exe)
